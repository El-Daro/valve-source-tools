function Import-Ini {
<#
	.SYNOPSIS
	Reads an .ini file and creates two corresponding objects: one for the settings and one for the comments

	.DESCRIPTION
	Reads through an .ini file and populates an ordered hashtable with sections that contain relative Key-Value pairs.

	A second hashtable (unordered) is created solely for the comments, each paired with a virtual 'key'.
	Comments can be single-line (SL), e.g occupying the whole line, or in-line (IL), e.g. following a key-value string.
	An in-line comment has the same key as `key-value` pair it relates to. The syntax for single-line comments differs.
	If an SL comment is preceeded by a valid Key-Value pair, the key is represented with `[<section-name>.<key>]` syntax.
	If an SL comment is preceeded by a valid section definition, the syntax is `[<section-name>.<section-name>]`.
	If an SL comment is not preceeded by anything or empty lines only, the virtual key is set to `[Global.Global]`.
	If a few SL comments are occupying different lines, they are grouped under the same key.
	If you delete a key from the `settings` table before passing it to the `Export-Ini` function,
	the referenced comment won't be included.

	.PARAMETER Path
	Specifies the path to the .ini file. Accepts absolute and relative paths. Does NOT accept wildcards.

	.PARAMETER IgnoreCommentsPattern
	Specifies a RegEx string for a specific comment pattern that has to be ignored. If you create your .ini files automatically, use
	a specific pattern for the comments that you include. For example, if you specify `"^#;.*;#`$"` with this parameter, a single-line
	comment string that starts with `#;` and ends with `;#` will be ingored and will not be included in the ouptut.
	When a common parameter `-Debug` is used, this parameter is assumed to be `"^#;.*;#`$"`, unless set explicitly by the caller.
	Use this parameter to prevent duplication of auto-generated comments.

	.INPUTS
	System.String
		You can pipe a string containing a path to this function.

	.OUTPUTS
	System.Collections.Hashtable
		Note that this function returns only one object:
			a hashtable that contains `settings` (System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary)
									and `comments` (System.Collections.Hashtable).

	.NOTES

	This function accepts sections denoted with `[` and `]`,
	valid key-value pairs and single-line or in-line comments starting with `;` or `#`.
	An empty line is ignored.
	A key cannot be empty or contain any of the following symbols: `[`, `]`, `;`, `#` and `=`.
	A value can be enclosed in single quotes (`' '`) or double quotes (`" "`).
	If a value is not enclosed in quotes, the comment characters (`;`, `#`) are not allowed inside
	and treated as comments on the first appearance. They are escaped otherwise.
	Poor syntax for the value can be forgiven, but in this case the function might yield unexpected results.
	It is up to the author of the .ini file to properly edit it.

	Note that this function returns only one object: a hashtable that contains `settings` and `comments` inside.
	When passed to `Export-Ini` function by the `-InputObject` parameter or through a pipeline,
	it 'unwraps' automatically, unless you change the names of the inner hashtables.

	.EXAMPLE
	PS> $iniFile = Import-Ini -Path ".\settings.ini"
	PS> $iniFile

	Name                           Value
	----                           -----
	comments                       {[Global, System.Collections.Hashtable], [Main, System.Collections.Hashtable]}
	settings                       {[Global, System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary], [Main, System.Collectiâ€¦
	
	PS> $iniFile["settings"]["Main"]

	Name                           Value
	----                           -----
	Logging                        true
	LogDir                         %UserProfile%\Documents\PowerShell\Logs
	
	PS> $iniFile["settings"]["Main"]["LogDir"]

	%UserProfile%\Documents\PowerShell\Logs
	
	.EXAMPLE
	PS> $iniFile = Import-Ini -Path ".\settings.ini"
	PS> $iniFile["settings"]["Main"]["LogDir"] = "c:\temp\"
	PS> Export-Ini -InputObject $iniFile -Path "settings.ini" -Force

	Note that when the `-InputObject` parameter of the `Export-Ini` function is used,
	it tries to locate `settings` and `comments` hashtable inside.
	If it fails to do so, the content is assumed to be the sections.
	
	.EXAMPLE
	PS> $iniFile = Import-Ini -Path ".\settings.ini"
	PS> $iniFile["settings"]["Main"]["Logging"] = "false"
	PS> Export-Ini -Settings $iniFile["settings"] -Path ".\settings_new.ini" 

	You can also pass only the "settings" part to the `Export-Ini` function. In this case comments won't be included.
	
	.EXAMPLE
	PS> $iniFile = Import-Ini -Path ".\settings.ini"
	PS> $iniFile["comments"]["Global"].Keys
	[Global.Global]
	PS> $iniFile["comments"]["Global"].Remove("[Global.Global]")
	PS> $iniFile["comments"]["Global"].Keys
	PS> Export-Ini -Settings $iniFile["settings"] -Comments $iniFile["comments"] -Path "settings_updated.ini"

	When working with the "comments" hashtable, note that single-line comments are groupped by one key even if they span across a few lines.
	A section with no definition is assumed to be "Global". If the "Global" section contains nothing, but commented lines,
	the comments are grouped under the "[Global.Global]" key. If you have a named section ("Main", for example)
	a single-line comment following the definition of the section is given the key "[Main.Main]".
	If a comment is preceeded by a valid Key-Value pair, the key is represented with "[<section-name>.<key>]" syntax.
	
	.EXAMPLE
	PS> Import-Ini "settings.ini" -IgnoreCommentsPattern "^##.*##`$" | Export-Ini -Path "settings_updated.ini"

	You can also pipe an object to the `Export-Ini` function.
